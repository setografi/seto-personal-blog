## Introduction

Steganography is the art of hiding information within another medium so that only the intended recipient can detect and extract the hidden message. One of the simplest and most popular steganographic techniques is Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.

## What is Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography?

Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography is a technique where the least significant bits of each byte in an image file are used to store secret data. The changes in these bits are so small that they are not noticeable to the human eye, making it ideal for hiding information.

## How LSB Steganography Works

In LSB steganography, the secret data is converted into binary form, and these bits are inserted into the least significant bits of each byte in the image pixels. For example, if we have a color byte (RGB) in an image that is 10101100 and we want to insert the data bit '1', the byte will change to 10101101.

## Importance of Delimiters

Delimiters are special markers used to indicate the start and end of the embedded secret data. Using delimiters is crucial to ensure that the data can be correctly extracted without losing information or mixing the original data with the embedded data.

## Suitable Image Formats

Lossless image formats such as PNG and BMP are more suitable for LSB steganography. These formats do not compress image data, so changes to the bits do not result in significant degradation of image quality.

## Steps to Hide Messages Using LSB

1. Choose an Image: Select an image in PNG or BMP format.
2. Convert the Message: Convert the message you want to hide into binary form.
3. Embed the Bits: Embed the message bits into the least significant bits of each byte in the image pixels.
4. Add Delimiters: Add delimiters at the start and end of the message.
5. Save the Image: Save the modified image.

## Conclusion

LSB steganography is an effective and simple technique for hiding messages in digital images. The importance of delimiters and choosing the right image format are key to the success of this technique. By understanding these basics, you can start your own experiments in the world of steganography.
